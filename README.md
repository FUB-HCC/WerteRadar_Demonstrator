# WerteRadar Demonstrator

## Background

The high-fidelity demonstrator that is available through this repository presents one of the key outcomes of the consortial research project "WerteRadar - Gesundheitsdaten souverän spenden". The overarching goal of the interdisciplinary project was to redesign the sharing of personal health data by capturing and evaluating existing stakeholder values, based on the Value Sensitive Design method. The aim is to enable patients to share their data in a self-determined and reflective way, taking into account aspects of data privacy.Further details regarding the research project "WerteRadar - Gesundheitsdaten souverän spenden" can be found on the following website: [WerteRadar](https://werteradar.org).


## Description
